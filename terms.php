                        <p>Selling your artwork as a product on Fearless Strokes is as simple as making a Post - except you make money from it. All you have to do is post your artwork to make it immediately available for
                            sale as a variety of products. When you sell a product, we&#39;ll produce it, package it and ship it for you, so that you can focus on making more art!</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;<b>In order to sell your artwork as prints or other products you must be a verified member of Fearless Strokes, this is how we pay you for your sales.</b></p>
                        <p><br><b>YOU CONTROL THE RIGHTS TO YOUR WORK</b></p>
                        <p>What&#39;s yours is yours! When you post your artwork on Fearless Strokes, you continue to control the rights to it.

						<p><b>RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES</b></p>
						<p>If a dispute arises between you and Fearless Strokes, you and Fearless Strokes agree that the parties will resolve any such claim (a "<b>Claim</b>") in accordance with one of the subsections below or as Fearless Strokes and you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may have arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Fearless Strokes Services must be filed within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arose.</p>

						<p><b>Law and Forum for Disputes</b> - These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within the State of Delaware between Delaware residents, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Fearless Strokes must be resolved by a court located in the state of Delaware, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the state of Delaware for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes and waive any objection to such jurisdiction, including forum non convenience.</p>

						<p><b>Arbitration Option</b> - For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, it shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("<b>ADR</b>") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions (the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration); b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

						<p><b>Improperly Filed Claims</b> - All claims you bring against Fearless Strokes must be resolved in accordance with this Resolution of Disputes Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to the Resolution of Disputes Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to the Resolution of Disputes Section, Fearless Strokes may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to the greater of (i) its actual attorneys' fees and costs; and (ii) $1,000, provided that Fearless Strokes has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>

						<p><b>GENERAL</b></p>
						<p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms. Any purported transfer or assignment in violation of the foregoing will be invalid. We may assign these Terms and our rights and obligations under them upon notice to you in accordance with the Notices Section. Headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such section. Our failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms or any rights under applicable law shall not constitute a waiver of any of those provisions or rights.</p>

						<p>These Terms may not be otherwise amended except in a writing signed by you and Fearless Strokes.  These Terms, including without limitation, the Privacy Policy which is incorporated herein by reference, set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and Fearless Strokes with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>
