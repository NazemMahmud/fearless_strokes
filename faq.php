                <p><b>Order & Shipping related FAQ's:</b></p> <br>
                <p><b>In How many days shall the products ordered be shipped?</b></p>
                <p>Every art is printed and crafted on demand, thus the entire printing, making & curing time varies from <b> 7 days to 10days </b> at max. </p>
                <br>

                <p><b>What is your return policy?</b></p>
                <p>We offer a <b>Return Policy</b> for all our products that have quality issues including damages on arrival; you can return the product to the delivery person. Other than this goods once bought cannot be exchanged.</p>
                <br>

                <p><b>Does the color of actual product match exactly with whatâ€™s shown on screen? </b></p>
                <p>
                    All the mock-ups of artworks and products displayed on website are computer generated and thus <b>minor color variation</b> in the actual product when compared to various screens on which artwork is being viewed is very natural.
                    Moreover, various products with similar artwork could also show slight color variance due to the property of surface, the artwork is printed on.
                    Having said that, do not expect a vast color inconsistency as we take most care in ensuring profiling & managing color range of each artwork being printed on demand giving true art reproduction.
